        <h3>First Phase</h3>
        <p>Scarf will first be protected by a barrier (reversed world border), preventing players from attacking him.
            Players must defeat Scarf's Undead, which include an  Undead Priest (Healer),  Undead Mage,  Undead Warrior (Berserk),
            and  Undead Archer. Each of the Undead works differently and use attacks or abilities corresponding to their role.</p>
        <h3>Second Phase</h3>
        <p>The barrier protecting Scarf disappears, and the second phase begins.
            All the Undead are revived and become stronger while players must also deal with Scarf.
            Scarf acts similar to the Warrior but uses many more abilities and is stronger. It is
            recommended to kill the Priest first in this phase, as he will heal Scarf if you do not kill him fast enough.</p>
