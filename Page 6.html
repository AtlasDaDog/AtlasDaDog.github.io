        <h2 style="color: darkred">Livid</h2>
        <p>Livid reveals a Dark Orb in the center of the arena as the remains of Thorn and that he is using its power to
            clone himself. He then blinds everyone for 1 second and spawns eight clones from Endermen. Each of these clones
            has the same amount of health and stats, but they have different nametag colors. The real Livid can be identified
            by looking at the color of the ceiling once the clones have spawned. When players kill a clone, it will regenerate
            all the way back to full HP and heal nearby clones by 25% of their maximum health. In Master Mode Catacombs - Floor
            V, all Livids will also gain a damage boost when a clone dies. Like Thorn, Livid has only one phase, which ends when
            the real Livid is killed (causing all clones to despawn).</p>
        <p>Unlike other bosses, the boss bar does not show Livid's remaining health, so players cannot determine which entity is him by damaging them separately.</p>
