        <h3>Boss Fight</h3>
        <p>Unlike most of the other bosses in The Catacombs, Thorn only has one apparent phase, same as Livid,
            however technically has different phases, but the differences are minuscule. Thorn will speed up
            the more he has been damaged and when he is about to die in one more hit, Thorn will start turning
            around, making it harder to hit him. Additionally, the mobs gain more HP, overall making it a longer fight.</p>
        <p>Thorn will summon Spirit Animals which can deal damage to the player along with a new Mini-Boss called the
            Spirit Bear. A counter (indicated by a ring of Sea Lanterns and Coal Blocks near the audience) shows how
            many Spirit Animals have been killed. When the ring fully lights up with Sea Lanterns, the Spirit Bear will spawn.</p>
        <p>There is a crowd of enemies cheering for Thorn in the arena. While they can't attack the player, they can give helpful
            hints for Thorn's attacks. Although, if the player enters the crowds viewing area, swarms of spirit bats will attack
            the player and deal large quantities of damage.</p>
        <p>Occasionally, one of the circles in the arena will change color, either green or orange. If it turns green, it will
            ready up a Healing Circle much like the Healer's one, but if it turns orange, it will start a fire on that circle.
            Thorn's spirit animals will take 5% of their HP every second they are in the fire.</p>
        <h2 style="color: saddlebrown">Spirit Bear</h2>
        <p>The Spirit Bear is a Mini-Boss summoned during the fight. It will be summoned once 100 Spirit Animals have been killed.
            It has 5M HP and can attack players with a Golden Sword or a Spirit Bow. The spirit bear will
            heal overtime, but very slowly.</p>
        <p>When the Spirit Bear is killed, an item called the Spirit Bow will appear, and the person who picks it up has only one
            shot at damaging Thorn. Four successful hits with the Spirit Bow will kill Thorn.</p>
