        <h3>Phase One</h3>
        <p>The Professor is surrounded by a barrier at the beginning of the fight, preventing players from dealing damage through it.
            To end the first phase, all The Professor's Guardians must be defeated. Each of the guardians has a special attack/ability. The Guardians are revived with 80% Health after 10 seconds of being killed.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>The Healthy Guardian</b> can perform Giga Heal, which heals every guardian in the room to full Health. However, landing 10 hits or more before the heal timer is up will startle the guardian and prevent the heal.</li>
            <li><b>The Chaos Guardian</b> is the most dangerous of the Guardians. Above its head is an Anger meter. Getting too close to it will cause it to discharge for 4000 Damage every second, and approaching it while it is on full Anger will result in it striking the player for 24000 Damage, twice per second.</li>
            <li><b>The Laser Guardian</b> will begin the fight by charging up a Focus Laser. This laser can be very annoying without an Aspect of the End to break its focus. Every second, it deals 175 True Damage to the player. After firing for about 10 seconds, it will overheat and cool down for a few seconds before resuming fire.</li>
            <li><b>The Reinforced Guardian</b> is the least dangerous of the guardians, only firing off some TNT every so often. However, this TNT can be difficult to avoid at times.</li>
        </ul>
            <p>Standing on any guardian's pedestal will cause them to body slam, dealing Knockback and 1500 Damage.
            Rogue Guardians will also spawn throughout the fight and fly around firing lasers at any nearby players. After being alive for some time, they will turn into Elder Rogue Guardians which deal more damage.</p>
        <h3>Phase Two</h3>
        <p>In the second phase, The Professor has 3,000,000 Health. When the Professor is brought down to 25% Health (750,000), The Professor undergoes his third and final phase.</p>
        <h3>Phase Three</h3>
        <p>In his third phase, the Professor absorbs the dead Elder Guardians and transforms into a Guardian himself. He will spawn Rogue Guardians, and occasionally use the Giga Heal,
            TNT Rain, and Focus Laser abilities. If the fight goes on for too long, the arena will flood but spawn in several boats. Once the Professor is defeated, Necron will smite him with
            lightning and warn the players not to go further before he deals with them himself.</p>
