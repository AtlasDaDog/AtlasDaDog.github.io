        What is Skyblock??
    </h2>
    <p>
        Hypixel Skyblock is an economy base grinding game often compared to an MMORPG (massively multiplayer online roleplaying game).
        It's a game mode within the server Hypixel, where rather than fighting for an object like other mini-games the players create their own objective within
        massive maps created within Minecraft.
    </p>


    <h2>
        What are Dungeon's?
    </h2>

    <p>
        Dungeons are a procedurally generated map in which players have to clear Whither rooms to get a key to move forwards.
        As you keep moving further inwards to get to what is called the Blood Room in which you have to kill tough enemies.
        Once Blood room is clear a portal Opens talking to the boss of that Floor.
    </p>
    <p>Each floor completion grants you xp for your Catacombs skill while killing monsters gives you xp towards you combat skill. The higher level the floor is the higher the required Catacombs level </p>
